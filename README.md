 UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS
Developed in collaboration with UNP, this Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of an organization's financial performance. It tracks total sales, gross and net profit, revenue trends, and cost management across different segments. The dashboard identifies the most profitable products, evaluates the impact of discounts on sales, and highlights cost optimization opportunities. Additional insights include year-over-year growth, profit margins, and financial health indicators, enabling data-driven decision-making and improved financial strategies.
